# TeX image generation

Some images were generated using the [sketch](http://www.frontiernet.net/~eugene.ressler/) package and also [sketch-lib](http://alexdu.github.io/sketch-lib/) for simplifying image generation. To do so using the `.sk` files here provided, just run:

```shell
$ sk2png file.sk
```

Just make sure to have **TeX**, **sketch** and **sketch-lib** installed.
