# Hexapod Robot: Project Shelob

It was always about **making something**. I will be making a new robot for myself, a project just for the sake of making a project. Will I probably be studying new subjects and learning new skills? Maybe. Will I use these skills professionally, academically, or usefully in any way? Probably not. But recently, due to the pandemic situation, I have been really _craving_ some type of creative labor and that is another attempt in dealing with this feeling.

### [**Embedded Software: running ROS2 on a Raspberry Pi**](./posts/20210509-embedded/)

_Posted on May 09, 2021_

For this task, I need to take into consideration all the development of embedded micro-controllers and CPU's over the years since I started working with robotics. I started by looking around my place for boards that I had already purchased in the past. [Read more](./posts/20210509-embedded/)

### [**ROS: using a framework for robotics**](./posts/20210424-ros/)

_Posted on April 24, 2021_

ROS stands for **Robot Operating System** and could be simply described as robotics middleware suite. The framework was originally designed to facilitate research on the academic environment but it's used today also in companies and hobbyist communities. ROS can be divided into four main parts: plumbing, development tools, robot capabilities and the ROS ecosystem. [Read more](./posts/20210424-ros/)

### [**Servomotors: get things moving**](./posts/20210418-servomotors/)

_Posted on April 18, 2021_

Servomotors one of the most commom actuators used for robotics projects. There are two main types of servomotors used for hexapod robots: **"smart" servomotor** and **hobby servomotors**. [Read more](./posts/20210418-servomotors/)

### [**Software Structure: trying to organize a complex project**](./posts/20210410-software_structure/)

_Posted on April 10, 2021_

It's common for a robotics software project to be divided into layers to abstract problems faced when dealing with high-level software to solve complex problems like navigation or vision and also with low-level software to move motors and read sensors.

### [**Inverse Kinematics: approaches**](./posts/20210410-kinematics/)

_Posted on April 10, 2021_

There are two type of solutions that I would like to try on this project: using Inverse Kinematics "from the ground up" as the Phoenix Code in some low-level language that could be used directly on the robot or a ROS (Robotic Operational System) approach. [Read more](./posts/20210410-kinematics/)

### [**Project Overview: How everything started**](./posts/20210403-overview/)

_Posted on April 3, 2021_

The idea is to build a hexapod robot using Inverse Kinematics for leg movements. The goal is to build (or just use and configure) an IK solver that provides scalability for common walking gait use cases: walking (of course), rotate body (row, pitch, yaw), terrain walking, single-leg control, etc. [Read more](./posts/20210403-overview/)
