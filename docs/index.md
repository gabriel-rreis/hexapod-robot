# Hexapod Robot: Project Shelob

It was always about **making something**. I will be making a new robot for myself, a project just for the sake of making a project. Will I probably be studying new subjects and learning new skills? Maybe. Will I use these skills professionally, academically, or usefully in any way? Probably not. But recently, due to the pandemic situation, I have been really *craving* some type of creative labor and that is another attempt in solving this feeling.
