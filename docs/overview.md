# Project Overview

Apr 3, 2021 

## Hexapod Robot

The idea is to build a hexapod robot using Inverse Kinematics for leg movements. The goal is to build (or just use and configure) an IK solver that provides scalability for common walking gait use cases: walking (of course), rotate body (row, pitch, yaw), terrain walking, single-leg control, etc. Also, I will be working on electronics and mechanical parts for the project, but I will probably start by simulating everything because it's cheaper and gives time to work around designing and getting the final parts.

There is plenty of projects like that around and I am yet to find what would be the specifics for each subject, but here are some guidelines that I will be taking from now on:

- Physical robot will be a six 3-DOF (degree of freedom) legged servo powered robot.
- Mechanical joints and body will be self-designed and 3D printed.
- Electronics will be something ready to use and not designed (for now).
- The final controlling system will be a mobile application, but I will probably start with an umbilical cable to power and command the hexapod.

## Project name

> *But still, she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness.*

— The Two Towers, "Shelob's Lair", **J. R. R. Tolkien**.

The name is just a reference to my favorite book of all time, Tolkien's Lord of The Rings trilogy. Besides the fact that spiders have eight legs and not six, I think it is a good name for an *Araneae*-like robot.
